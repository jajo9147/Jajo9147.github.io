This repository contains my personal resume and project portfolio.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Projects

### [PyTorch Tabular Binary Classifier](https://github.com/jajo9147/pytorch-tabular-binary-classifier)
A neural network built in PyTorch for binary classification on structured tabular data, simulating real-world use cases like customer churn prediction or ISR target classification. Achieved 89% accuracy using BCEWithLogitsLoss and ReLU activations.

### [Customer Churn Prediction with Flask + GitHub Pages](https://github.com/jajo9147/Customer-Churn-Prediction)  
An end-to-end ML pipeline for predicting customer churn. Includes model training in Jupyter, deployment via Flask API, and a frontend form hosted with GitHub Pages. Users input customer info and receive real-time churn probabilities using a logistic regression model.

## 🎨 Creative Coding & Visualization

### [P5.js Dynamic Wave Animation](https://github.com/jajo9147/dynamic-black-line-animation)
A procedural wave animation built with P5.js, designed for embedding in BI dashboards and presentations. The animation's rhythm is controlled by mathematical parameters, featuring a wave whose frequency and amplitude change dynamically across the screen. Includes a custom-drawn, animated logo with gradient effects and is hosted via GitHub Pages for live embedding.
